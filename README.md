This report analyzes the economic growth trends of three countries at different development stages. 
For the case study, we consider analyzing the United States of America as a representative of an advanced economy, China as a representative of an emerging economy, and Ethiopia as a representative of a low-income economy. We will identify key determinants of growth and compare its performance with that of other selected countries to derive meaningful insights.
This project examines annual time series data from 2005 to 2019, with a focus on both the economic growth trends and their stability over the years. Key economic indicators such as GDP, the country’s capital stock, employment levels, and the stability of the monetary system provide valuable insights into the country's economic growth rate during this period.
The methods used for data collection and analysis in this study are centered on leveraging credible secondary data sources and applying robust statistical techniques. Data was gathered from well-established international organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, and FRED, along with national statistics websites, including the central bank’s database for economic statistics and indicators. These sources provide comprehensive and reliable datasets, ensuring the accuracy and comparability of the analysis. Statistical techniques were employed to evaluate economic growth and sustainability by analyzing trends, identifying patterns, and assessing the consistency of growth over time. Additionally, we concentrate our attention to analyze relationships between GDP growth and the selected population growth, investment rates, employment levels, and monetary stability. To enhance understanding and interpretability, visualizations were created using Python. These visual tools, including line graphs, bar charts, and scatterplots, effectively illustrated trends and relationships between variables, facilitating deeper insights into the dynamics of economic growth.
